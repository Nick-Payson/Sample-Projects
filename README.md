# Sample-Projects
Sample code projects from college CS classes, mostly pulled from homework assignments.
Done.zip is my Java project 'marble solitaire'. It was completed for my Object Oriented Design class, and uses an MVC design to allow a user to play various kinds of marble solitaire games. The code is thoroughly tested with Junit4.
